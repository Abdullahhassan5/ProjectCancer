Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of exocrine pancreatic cancer. It is the most common type of pancreatic cancer â€“ 95 out of 100 (95%) of all pancreatic cancers are PDAC.

PDAC develops from cells lining small tubes in the pancreas called ducts (duct cells in the diagram above). These carry the digestive juices, which contain enzymes, into the main pancreatic duct and then on into the duodenum (first part of the small intestine).

PDAC can grow anywhere in the pancreas, though it is most often found in the head of the pancreas. Symptoms can include tummy (abdominal) and back pain, weight loss and changes to bowel habits. Read more about the symptoms of PDAC.

Cutaneous Melanoma
Location Skin
Cutaneous melanoma is a cancer that starts in the pigment-producing cells of the skin.

Cutaneous melanoma causes more than 10,000 deaths each year, but it has a 98 percent five-year survival rate when caught early.

Some melanomas are non-cutaneous.

Non-cutaneous melanomas are extremely rare.

They tend to show up in places that we don't often think of as skin, such as the:

Eyes
Inside of the nose
Mucous membranes (inside the mouth, vagina, anus, and rectum)
